<h2>The Secret Sauce of Pirate Chain</h2>
<p>Only Pirate Chain privacy and anonymity cryptocurrency has <strong>perfect fungibility</strong>, through <strong>perfect privacy and anonymity</strong>, powered by cryptographic Zero-Knowledge proofs and mandatory privacy.</p>
<h2>Unique Value</h2>
<p>The waters around the term "fungibility" have become incredibly muddied in the communities of other coins, leading to lies and FUD. It's an "either/or", rather than a "matter of degrees" situation when it comes to fungibility. There's no such thing as being "mostly fungible" or "kind of fungible". <strong>You either have it or you don't.</strong></p>
<h2>Zero History Equals Perfect Protection</h2>
<p>Perfect fungibility means zero history. When government regulators partner with blockchain analysis companies to regulate coins with history, they'll find that Pirate Chain coins have exactly zero history. No history? Nothing to trace. Nobody they can find to discriminate against. Besides, what legitimate business do governments and banks have, trying to regulate <span style="text-decoration: underline;">international money</span>? <strong>Only one Pirate Chain coin equals one Pirate Chain coin</strong>. That comes from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perfect</span> privacy and anonymity coupled with mandatory privacy for each transaction. <strong>No other coin has this, including Monero. </strong></p>
<h2>Size Matters</h2>
<p>When it comes to the size of your haystack, when government financial regulators come along trying to find your needle: Size matters. The size of Pirate Chain's haystack or "anonset" is in the millions and due to Pirate Chain's mandatory privacy, the size of that haystack grows with every transaction.</p>
<h2>A Safe Harbor</h2>
<p>Pirate Chain is the only safe harbor. It's really important that the public become aware of this fact, due to the coming storm of the King's CBDCs that aim to enslave us all. <time datetime="2024-07-04T22:49:20.424Z" aria-label="Edited Today at 3:49 PM"></time></p>
